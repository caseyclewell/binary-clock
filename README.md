# binary-clock
Rasberry Pi Pico binary clock project in MicroPython
Original code written by Gary Sims. The original code has been modified to support two 8x8 LED displays, one for H:M:S
and one for D:M:Y. The code changes also support a button to select display modes and saves the last selected 
display mode to flash.
